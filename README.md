# Hi, Iâ€™m Dominic Chalcraft ðŸ‘‹

A fullstack developer with a focus on backend development, SysAdmin and DevOps. The main languages I use profesionally are Ruby and Ruby on Rails for web development and Ansible/Terraform for provisioning, configuration and infrastructure control. I use this account for professional engagements while keeping my personal Github account separate.
